With this project we stuck with hash tables due to the efficency of if its storage and retrieval, with hash tables only having a constant-time average of O(1)for insertion deletion and retrieval operations it makes it a fast and efficent data structure. Because of this constant time average it'll scale very well. Even as the program begins to take in a large amount of movies the hash table's performance won't be significantly impacted, remaining efficent.
